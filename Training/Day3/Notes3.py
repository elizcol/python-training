not much point of interfaces since we dont know what methods will be in the class, can add them later during run time
since dynamic language - duck typing
try something, let it raise exception

when downloading on PyPI want high numbers - pip it instead of download..

sometimes want to have a virtual environment, so can install things into the base install instead of that being affected, eg knowing dependencies
is a package to brew, virtualenv useful for django stuff
(python3) virtualenv -p /baseinstallpythonbinary nameOfEnv
source nameOfEnv/bin/activate
pip un/install .. (WTTE)
deactivate
which pip
pip freeze - says what have installed, into a readme  

instead of maven - SCons

with statements for real resources
